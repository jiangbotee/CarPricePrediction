# Car Price Prediction (End-to-End Project)
This is a data science project that encompasses data collection, cleaning, feature engineering, modelling and finally deployment.

## Goal
The goal of the project was to create and deploy a model that could predict the selling price of vehicles in the GTA (Greater Toronto Area). On a personal level, this project allowed me to experience the challenges of using real-world data and not simply pulling from a cleaned dataset.


## Instructions
- Open carPricePrediction.ipynb for the Python Notebook. This includes all of the data cleaning, engineering, visualization and model building. 
- kijijiScraper.py is the custom built webscraper for collecting vehicle data from Kijiji Autos.
- Run app.py to start a local version of the webapp.
- Go to: https://car-prediction-end-to-end.herokuapp.com for the full Heroku version
